# MachineLearning-WindowsEventLogs
An experiment which takes in an event logs file and uses experimental machine learning to find malicious Activity.  

17/10 : A powershell Script that allows the user to extract their own event logs from the past week, outputting two logs systems and secruity csv. 
    -> This will let the user train the model from their very own dataset.
    -> I can't share my own but this should be a quick way to test.
